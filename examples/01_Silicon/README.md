This code reproduces Supplentary Figure 11b of the [Uncovering the effects of interface-induced ordering of liquid on crystal growth using machine learning

Note that the slight discrepancies in the results are due to the difference in system size. The reference results were obtained using ~20,000 atoms, whereas in this study, only ~2,000 atoms were used to reduce computational cost, while maintaining a roughly cubic geometry.
